    >For example, whole-exome sequencing is a lower-cost alternative to whole genome sequencing. In exome sequencing, only the coding, exon-producing regions of the DNA are sequenced. In 2010, whole-exome sequencing was used to save a young boy whose intestines had multiple mysterious abscesses. The child had several colon operations with no relief. Finally, whole-exome sequencing was performed, which revealed a defect in a pathway that controls apoptosis (programmed cell death). A bone-marrow transplant was used to overcome this genetic disorder, leading to a cure for the boy. He was the first person to be successfully treated based on a diagnosis made by whole-exome sequencing. Today, human genome sequencing is more readily available and can be completed in a day or two for about $1000.</p

      >The basic sequencing technique used in all modern day sequencing projects is the chain termination method (also known as the dideoxy method), which was developed by Fred Sanger in the 1970s. The chain termination method involves DNA replication of a single-stranded template with the use of a primer and a regular <span
          class="term"
        >deoxynucleotide</span
      > (dNTP), which is a monomer, or a single unit, of DNA. The primer and dNTP are mixed with a small proportion of fluorescently labeled <span
          class="term"
        >dideoxynucleotides</span
      > (ddNTPs). The ddNTPs are monomers that are missing a hydroxyl group (&#x2013;OH) at the site at which another nucleotide usually attaches to form a chain (<a

      >). Each ddNTP is labeled with a different color of fluorophore. Every time a ddNTP is incorporated in the growing complementary strand, it terminates the process of DNA replication, which results in multiple short strands of replicated DNA that are each terminated at a different point during replication. When the reaction mixture is processed by gel electrophoresis after being separated into single strands, the multiple newly replicated DNA strands form a ladder because of the differing sizes. Because the ddNTPs are fluorescently labeled, each band on the gel reflects the size of the DNA strand and the ddNTP that terminated the reaction. The different colors of the fluorophore-labeled ddNTPs help identify the ddNTP incorporated at that position. Reading the gel on the basis of the color of each band on the ladder produces the sequence of the template strand (<a

          >Shotgun sequencing</span
        > is a method used to cut multiple DNA fragments to generate the sequence of a large piece of DNA. This was the first strategy used to sequence large DNA fragments, which eventually led to whole-genome sequencing. In the shotgun sequencing method, DNA is fragmented into small pieces and then sequenced multiple times by the chain termination method. Overlapping sequences help to piece together fragments in the correct order to get the sequence of a large piece of DNA. A <span

          >contig</span
        > is a larger sequence assembled from overlapping shorter sequences. Each sequencing run provides a sequence of 500 to 1000 base pairs starting from each end. The sequence between the ends is deciphered from overlapping clones using PCR amplification, recloning, and sequencing. This technique seems more cumbersome than shotgun sequencing, but it is easier to reconstruct the pieces because there is more available information.</p

Although the study of medical applications of genome sequencing is interesting, this discipline tends to dwell on abnormal gene function. Knowledge of the entire genome will allow future onset diseases and other genetic disorders to be discovered early, which will allow for more informed decisions to be made about lifestyle, medication, and having children.
