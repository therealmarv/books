    <p class="para" id="fs-idm126310480">Although life histories describe the way many characteristics of a population (such as their age structure) change over time in a general way, population ecologists make use of a variety of methods to model population dynamics mathematically. These more precise models can then be used to accurately describe changes occurring in a population and better predict future changes. Certain models that have been accepted for decades are now being modified or even abandoned due to their lack of predictive ability, and scholars strive to create effective new models.</p>
    <h1 id="fs-idm165508688" class="title">Exponential Growth</h1>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm142026480">Charles Darwin, in his theory of natural selection, was greatly influenced by the English clergyman Thomas Malthus. Malthus published a book in 1798 stating that populations with unlimited natural resources grow very rapidly, and then population growth decreases as resources become depleted. This accelerating pattern of increasing population size is called <span class="term">exponential growth</span>.</p>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm256913536">The best example of exponential growth is seen in bacteria. Bacteria are prokaryotes that reproduce by prokaryotic fission. This division takes about an hour for many bacterial species. If 1000 bacteria are placed in a large flask with an unlimited supply of nutrients (so the nutrients will not become depleted), after an hour, there is one round of division and each organism divides, resulting in 2000 organisms—an increase of 1000. In another hour, each of the 2000 organisms will double, producing 4000, an increase of 2000 organisms. After the third hour, there should be 8000 bacteria in the flask, an increase of 4000 organisms. The important concept of exponential growth is that the <span class="term">population growth rate</span>—the number of organisms added in each reproductive generation—is accelerating; that is, it is increasing at a greater and greater rate. After 1 day and 24 of these cycles, the population would have increased from 1000 to more than 16 billion. When the population size, <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em>, is plotted over time, a <span class="term">J-shaped growth curve</span> is produced (<a href="#fig-ch45_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>).</p>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm137193024">The bacteria example is not representative of the real world where resources are limited. Furthermore, some bacteria will die during the experiment and thus not reproduce, lowering the growth rate. Therefore, when calculating the growth rate of a population, the <span class="term">death rate (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">D</em>)</span> (number organisms that die during a particular time interval) is subtracted from the <span class="term">birth rate (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">B</em>)</span> (number organisms that are born during that interval). This is shown in the following formula:</p>

    <h1 id="fs-idm166886608" class="title">Logistic Growth</h1>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm178752016">Exponential growth is possible only when infinite natural resources are available; this is not the case in the real world. Charles Darwin recognized this fact in his description of the “struggle for existence,” which states that individuals will compete (with members of their own or other species) for limited resources. The successful ones will survive to pass on their own characteristics and traits (which we know now are transferred by genes) to the next generation at a greater rate (natural selection). To model the reality of limited resources, population ecologists developed the <span class="term">logistic growth</span> model.</p>
    <h2 id="fs-idm262936464" class="title">Carrying Capacity and the Logistic Model</h2>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm165983232">In the real world, with its limited resources, exponential growth cannot continue indefinitely. Exponential growth may occur in environments where there are few individuals and plentiful resources, but when the number of individuals gets large enough, resources will be depleted, slowing the growth rate. Eventually, the growth rate will plateau or level off (<a href="#fig-ch45_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>). This population size, which represents the maximum population size that a particular environment can support, is called the <span class="term">carrying capacity, or <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em></span>.</p>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idp3422736">The formula we use to calculate logistic growth adds the carrying capacity as a moderating force in the growth rate. The expression “<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em> – <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em>” is indicative of how many individuals may be added to a population at a given stage, and “<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em> – <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em>” divided by “<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em>” is the fraction of the carrying capacity available for further growth. Thus, the exponential growth model is restricted by this factor to generate the logistic growth equation:</p>

On the other hand, when <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">N</em> is large, (<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K-N</em>)/<em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em> come close to zero, which means that population growth will be slowed greatly or even stopped. Thus, population growth is greatly slowed in large populations by the carrying capacity <em class="emphasis" data-effect="italics">K</em>. This model also allows for the population of a negative population growth, or a population decline. This occurs when the number of individuals in the population exceeds the carrying capacity (because the value of (K-N)/K is negative.</p>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm33644512">A graph of this equation yields an <span class="term">S-shaped curve</span> (<a href="#fig-ch45_03_01" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a>), and it is a more realistic model of population growth than exponential growth. There are three different sections to an S-shaped curve. Initially, growth is exponential because there are few individuals and ample resources available. Then, as resources begin to become limited, the growth rate decreases. Finally, growth levels off at the carrying capacity of the environment, with little change in population size over time.</p>
    <h2 id="fs-idm75674912" class="title">Role of Intraspecific Competition</h2>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm37604320">The logistic model assumes that every individual within a population will have equal access to resources and, thus, an equal chance for survival. For plants, the amount of water, sunlight, nutrients, and the space to grow are the important resources, whereas in animals, important resources include food, water, shelter, nesting space, and mates.</p>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm178436096">In the real world, phenotypic variation among individuals within a population means that some individuals will be better adapted to their environment than others. The resulting competition between population members of the same species for resources is termed <strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold"><span class="term">intraspecific competition</span></strong>(intra- = “within”; -specific = “species”). Intraspecific competition for resources may not affect populations that are well below their carrying capacity—resources are plentiful and all individuals can obtain what they need. However, as population size increases, this competition intensifies. In addition, the accumulation of waste products can reduce an environment’s carrying capacity.</p>
    <h2 id="fs-idm69230000" class="title">Examples of Logistic Growth</h2>
    <p class="para" id="fs-idm32635216">Yeast, a microscopic fungus used to make bread and alcoholic beverages, exhibits the classical S-shaped curve when grown in a test tube (<a href="#fig-ch45_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold">a</strong>). Its growth levels off as the population depletes the nutrients that are necessary for its growth. In the real world, however, there are variations to this idealized curve. Examples in wild populations include sheep and harbor seals (<a href="#fig-ch45_03_02" class="autogenerated-content">[link]</a><strong class="emphasis" data-effect="bold">b</strong>). In both examples, the population size exceeds the carrying capacity for short periods of time and then falls below the carrying capacity afterwards. This fluctuation in population size continues to occur as the population oscillates around its carrying capacity. Still, even with this oscillation, the logistic model is confirmed.</p>
